# Modern Fashion Marketplace

A modern fashion marketplace designed to deliver a smooth, immersive, and user-friendly shopping experience across both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - For clear and semantic page structure
- **CSS** - For custom styling, animations, and visual consistency
- **JavaScript** - For interactivity and dynamic behavior
- **React** - For building reusable UI components and managing application state
- **React Bootstrap** - For responsive layouts, grids, and accessible UI components

## UI Design Approach

The user interface focuses on clean aesthetics and fashion-forward visuals, ensuring the platform feels premium and modern.

- **Minimalist layout** with proper spacing and typography
- **High-quality product cards** with images, price, and quick actions
- **Consistent color palette** aligned with fashion branding
- **Smooth transitions and hover effects** for better visual feedback

## UX Design and User Flow

The user experience is designed to be intuitive and friction-free, allowing users to browse and shop effortlessly.

- **Simple navigation** with clear categories and filters
- **Fast product discovery** and easy scrolling
- **Clear call-to-action buttons** (Add to Cart, View Details, Checkout)
- **Logical flow** from product browsing -> selection -> checkout

## Responsive and Mobile-First Experience

The marketplace is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes.

- **Mobile-first layout** for smartphones and tablets
- **Touch-friendly buttons** and cards
- **Optimized images** and components for smaller screens
- **Desktop version enhanced** with wider layouts and richer visuals

## Immersive Shopping Experience

By combining React's component-based architecture with Bootstrap's responsive system, the platform provides:

- **Smooth navigation** without page reloads
- **Fast interactions** and real-time UI updates
- **A shopping experience** that feels app-like on mobile and powerful on desktop

## Production Hardening Checklist

- Serve the API over HTTPS in production.
- Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in a secure secret manager.
- Restrict CORS origins to your exact production domain.
- Add rate limiting on `/api/checkout/create-session` and `/api/webhooks/stripe`.
- Persist webhook event IDs to prevent duplicate processing across restarts.
- Run dependency audits regularly (npm and pip).

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Product search and advanced filtering
- User accounts and wishlists
- Cart persistence and checkout flow
- Dark mode for fashion-focused aesthetics
